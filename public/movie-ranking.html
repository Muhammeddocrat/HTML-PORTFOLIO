<h2> My Top Three Lectures of all time </h2>

<h3>Trust in Allah </h3>
<p> This short clip edited and cut posted on Tik Tok.<br/>
    Why does it relate to me, there was a stage in life where i trusted someone to some extent
     and they broke it,this clip serves to remind humanity that if you ever trust anyone , trust Allah , cause people can buckle and break but Allah is the absolute truth . 

</p>
<H3>Tawakkul in Allah </H3>
<P>Quite simple breakdown :
    <br/> 1- Plan with Precision 
    <Br/> 2- Execute with excellence  
    <br/> 3- Result [Weather good or bad , lnow that is what Allah has decreed and at the time it might not make sense , but theres always something you have been save from that at the time you could not have noticed]

<h3> Duaa</h3>
<P>Duaa , Duaa , Duaa . You may say you make duaa but nothings happening , well the fact that you duaa shows that you dont have faith in what you asked for. <br/> When the Nabi(SAW) asked for the moon to be split , he had yaqeen (faith) in Allah . He knew Allah is the most powerfull , he knew what he has asked for will be taken care of because he asked Allah . When making duaa we often dont have faith , we think that it wont be accepted , but if we have faith that the duaa will be accepted then it will be . Yes it maybe at the time you dont see its acceptance but when you do , it will n=bring you closer to Allah Jalla-Jalalooh
